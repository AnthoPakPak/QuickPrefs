**Quickly access tweak prefs with Force Touch. This is a Theos iOS tweak.**

QuickPrefs is a little -yet useful- tweak that lets you quickly access tweak preferences with Force Touch on Settings app. Are you often changing settings of a specific tweak and are tired of searching it in your -so long- settings page? Or you're a tweak developer who is currently working on its tweak setting page? QuickPrefs is for you! You can add up to 4 tweak names that will be added to the stock Force Touch Settings items.

- Add up to 4 items to Force Touch Settings.app menu
- Choose whether you want to show items before or after stock items

**Available for free on BigBoss.**
