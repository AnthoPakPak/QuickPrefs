You can write the name of a tweak to directly open its preferences pane. Custom paths are also supported to allow open as many Settings.app preferences panes as possible. You can write items names as paths to dive into subcategories of Settings.app categories.

For stock Settings panes, the values to use for the path are not straightforward. To find out the path you want, enable \"Path Finder\" option above, and long press rows you're interested in to build the path. It will reveal the identifier of the row, and allow you to copy it to clipboard. This way you can build paths like \"ACCESSIBILITY/DISPLAY_AND_TEXT/Smart Invert\". You can disable this setting after you have found your path. Check out the video below to see how to do.";
